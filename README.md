# Shine
An app for the LGBTQ+ homeless to find the resources they need. This app was built over a period of five weeks for the Hack4Equality hackathon. On September 24, 2016 participators presented their projects to a multiple judges in Los Angeles. 

Shine runs on a Firebase backend, allowing users to create a username and password to login in. There are three tabs - community feed providing live updates of LGBTQ+ related events, resources, and anything that could help someone in need. The second tab displays a map with LGBTQ+ friendly services and organizations in Los Angeles. If a pin is tapped, the user will be given directions to that location using Apple Maps. If the user did not have access to data or wifi, the third tab would provide them with a list of all the locations and a brief summary of information for them. 

This app was built with Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.
